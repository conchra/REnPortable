# REnPortable
## A portable R environment for Windows

REnPortable is a portable R x64 environment for Windows. It was put together using the [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com) launcher but is not endorsed by and does not comply with PortableApps.com requirements.

Please note that to use REnPortable you need to supply your own copy of [R(base)](https://cloud.r-project.org/), [Rtools](https://cloud.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (Open Source Edition). REnPortable was tested with R v3.5.1, Rtools v3.4, and RStudio Desktop Open Source v1.1.453 on a Windows 10 (x64) machine. No support is offered for any of these programs. Please use the relevant support pages.

The reason for putting together REnPortablewas to have a complete, portable R environment to learn R and [RStan](http://mc-stan.org/). Therefore, all the prliminary work is complete to install the [RStan for Windows](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Installing-RStan-on-Windows) packages into REnPortable.
