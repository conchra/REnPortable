Makevars.win is used by Rtools when building custom packages.
Included based on: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started
However, the rstan package can produce errors if Makevars.win those settings 
indicated. Therefore, as also noted on 
https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started, it is better to 
leave Makevars.win blank or delete the file.
